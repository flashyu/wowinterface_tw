*If you are not level 60:* Hellfire Peninsula was designed with enough quests to get a level 60 character up to maybe half way through level 61, meaning Blizzard intended that if you are significantly below 60 you will probably have substantial grind in Hellfire that cannot be avoided. Be aware that you will likely level faster by grinding in Hellfire than you will by questing in Eastern Kingdoms or Kalimdor.
