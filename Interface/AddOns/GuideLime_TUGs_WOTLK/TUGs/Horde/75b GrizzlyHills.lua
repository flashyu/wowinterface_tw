I am leaving out EVERY Elite quest and most dungeons in this guide. especially on release YOU SHOULD NOT!!! You'll easily find groups for elite quests and dungeons. Do them as often as you can and at least once for their quests!
Two elite quests I will mark as optional. Do them as soon as you find people to do them with.
