[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-TBC-Classic/compare/2.5.31...2.5.32) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-TBC-Classic/releases)

- prep new tags to get some core fixes out  
- Fix a bug where having voice pack meant no DBM\_Announce callback would fire on special announcements (annoucements didn't have issue). This bug has existed since always but only got noticed because VEM was recently added as built in and on by default.  
- Update koKR (#94) Co-authored-by: Adam <MysticalOS@users.noreply.github.com>  
- New Timers Table Util, to handle nil's on dc/reload  
- Finally fix dark barrage now that RWF is over. Closes #108  
- bump alpha revisions
