- prep new release  
- Sync changes  
- Re-enable unit event stuff on Ysondre closes #44  
- fix typo  
- Return to supporting both retail and bcc encounter Ids, since BCC is now using retail Ids.. suporting both just ensures no further issues.

- Fix reported typo  
- Update koKR (BCC) (#43)  
- bump alpha
